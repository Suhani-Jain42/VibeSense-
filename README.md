# 🎵 VibeSense – Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System
VibeSense is a machine learning project that detects a user's emotion in real time using a webcam and recommends songs based on the detected mood. The system further personalizes recommendations by allowing users to choose their preferred language and singer, creating a customized and engaging music experience.

## 📌 Project Description
VibeSense combines computer vision and machine learning to understand human emotions through facial expressions. Once the emotion is identified, the system interacts with the user to collect music preferences and then suggests suitable songs that match both the user's mood and choice.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect user emotions using facial expressions
- Classify emotions using a trained machine learning model
- Take user input for preferred language and singer
- Recommend songs based on emotional state
- Provide a personalized music recommendation experience

## 🧠 Emotions Recognized
- Happy  
- Sad  
- Angry  
- Neutral  
- Surprise  
- Fear  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Machine Learning:** Deep Learning / CNN  
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow/Keras, Matplotlib  
- **Hardware:** Webcam  

## ⚙️ Workflow
1. Webcam captures the user's facial expression  
2. Face detection and preprocessing are performed  
3. Emotion is classified using a trained ML model  
4. User selects preferred language and singer  
5. System recommends songs based on detected mood  
6. Results are displayed to the user  

## 🗂️ Dataset
- Facial expression image dataset
- Images are labeled according to emotions
- Dataset was preprocessed using resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques

## 🚀 Features
